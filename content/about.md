Hey I’m Emma Petruchyk. My passion lies in creating warm and timeless images that tell a story and make you feel special.

My goal is to make every session feel natural and fun, so you feel completely at ease and your true personality shines through.

I love to be at my desk editing every detail to perfection. I love exploring the latest photography trends, learning new techniques, and finding fresh inspiration to keep my work vibrant and unique while staying true to my warm, inviting style.

Photography, for me, is more than just a profession—it’s a way to create lasting memories and capture the beauty in life’s most fleeting moments. 
I’m always on the lookout for best locations and creative ideas to make each session as special as the people I photograph. Let’s create something beautiful together!
